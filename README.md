# Overview

This is a C# tic tac toe consle program I created to help me not only get back into the flow of C#, but to research different ways I can go about make a simple program. After a lot of research I decided to base this program of 2d arrays to allow me to make this program easily scaliable & allow me to be able to add a lot of features to the game. The hope was to create a tic tac toe program that could easily be scaled to the size of a checkers board & if I had enough time, have multible game modes

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment
tools that I used to develop the software:
The 2 tools I used where VS code to write my code in & check for bugs & typos, and W3school's try it your self feature to test small pieces on code to better understand how it worked.

the programming language that I used and any libraries:
I used c# which is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language used to create software. I did not use any other libraries in this program as I started this project believe I had all the tools I needed in VS code after my starting research.

# Useful Websites

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php): This is where I spent half of my time while researching as it not only has a lot of information, but also lets me try code & remember the difference in syntax through the try it your self feature
- [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com): This was the form I gathered a lot of ideas from that I learned that 2d arrays are a thing from

# Future Work
list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future:

- Fix player 2 being able to take their turn after player 1 wins
- make it so that player can not over ride a spot that already has been writen on.
- impove gameover funtion to detect if that game ended in a cat
