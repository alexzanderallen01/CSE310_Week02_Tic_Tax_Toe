This is a C# checker console program I created to help me to research different ways I can go about programming and developing. After a lot of research I decided to base this program of 2d arrays to allow me to make this program easily scaliable & allow me to be able to add a lot of features to the game. I wanted to be able to

tools that I used to develop the software:
The 2 tools I used where VS code to write my code in & check for bugs & typos, and W3school's try it your self feature to test small pieces on code to better understand how it worked.

I used c# which is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language used to create software. I did not use any other libraries in this program yet, but I want to try out some library for dealing with graphs to better handle where I want to take this project.

Websites & other tools I used when making this:
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php): I spent a lot of my time while researching here as it not only has a lot of information, but also lets me try code & remember the difference in syntax through the try it your self feature
- [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com): This was the form I gathered a lot of ideas from and found a lot of tips on how to make things either better or how to make things work.
- [github](https://github.com/jcscruggs/WPF-Checkers/tree/master/checkers_game) &
- [github](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-console-games/tree/main/Projects/Checkers): These are 2 other c# checker games I looked through & spented a lot of time trying to understand & research. Both of them generate a board out side of the console and are a lot more complex then what I ever planned on doing, but they helped me get a much better understanding on the tools I can use to make my program. None of their code is in my project, but I did get some ideas from them that are somewhat implemented into my project so I wanted to give them credit.

list of things that I need to fix or improve in the future:
- Fix player 2 being able to take their turn after player 1 wins
- change the player movement to its own class
- add in getting a queen & queen movement
